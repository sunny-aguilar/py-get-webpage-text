## How to Run

### Genesis of this Program
I created this script when came accross an article that had a long set of questions. I wanted to get all of the text to save the questions but the article was really spammy with pictures, ads, and other weird designs that got in the way of a simple copy and paste. The article was really long too so it would have been tedious to do it by hand. So I spent the next 15 minutes creating this simple script to help me solve this problem and hopefully re-use again.
